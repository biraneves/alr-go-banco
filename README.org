> Project developed during the course *Go: Orientação a Objetos* (Go: Object Orientation), by [[https://alura.com.br][Alura]].

* Project Overview

This project, a key component on the *Go: Object Orientation* course offered by Alura, demonstrates the implementation of fundamental banking operations. It features both checking and savings account functionalities, meticulously crafted using object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts in Go.

* Execution Environment

- *Platform:* console-based application.

* Technologies Utilized

- *Primary Language:* Go.

* Future Enhancements

- [ ] Developing a user-friendly text-bases interface within the console.
- [ ] Introducing account holder registration features.
- [ ] Implementing data persistence for long-time information storage.

* Challenges Encountered

The primary challenge was transitioning from the traditional OOP methodologies, commonly seen in languages like Java, to the unique approach adopted by Go. This transition, while challenging, proved to be a valuable learning experience, pushing the boundaries of my conventional programming practices.
