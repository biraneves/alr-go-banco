# Bank account - basic features in Go with OO

> Project developed during the course **Go: Orientação a Objetos** (Go: Object Orientation), by [Alura](https://alura.com.br).

## Description
Basic bank account operation functionality, in checking and savings account versions, using an object-oriented approach.

### Runtime environment
Console.

### Adopted technologies
Go language.

## What's next
To go further, the idea is to develop at least three new features:

- user interface (text, in console);
- registration of account holders;
- data persistence.

## Main difficulties
Essentially, my main difficulty was to deconstruct the classic object-oriented approach of languages based on this paradigm (like Java, for example). The implementation of this paradigm by the Go language is very different from what I'm used to, which was good, forcing me to get out of my comfort zone.
